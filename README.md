# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Logic

**Date:** April 22, 2025

Today, I worked on building the logic for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript.

### 1. **Winning Conditions**
- The game checks if either "X" or "O" has won by getting three of the same marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

### 2. **Draw Condition**
- The game checks if all the spots on the board are filled and there's no winner. If so, the game is a draw.

### 3. **Game Not Finished**
- The game checks if there are still empty spots left on the board. If so, the game continues and is not finished.

### 4. **Test Cases**
- I checked all test cases to ensure the logic works correctly for winning, drawing, and unfinished games.

This exercise helped me improve my problem-solving skills and work with game logic.
